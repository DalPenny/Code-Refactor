#Horiseon Accessibility Code Refactor 

#Refactor of the Horiseon web page to follow accessibility standards and optimize for search engines.

#User Story:
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards 
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

#Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

#Changes Made:

Added comments in HTML and CSS files to clarify and make more readable 

* Made Title more descriptive 
* added semantic tags (header, nav, section, article, aside, footer) and replaced div with the appropriate tag
* added alt text for images for accessibility 
* fixed missing id to make subheading links work correctly
* consolidated benefit class into one
